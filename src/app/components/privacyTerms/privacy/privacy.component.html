                Mode and place of processing the Data
              </h2>
              <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
              <p>
                The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
                unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
                destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out
                using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following
                organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the
                purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
                Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
                involved with the operation of this Application (administration,
                sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external
                parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail
                carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications
                agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the
                Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from
                the Owner at any time.
              </p>
              <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
              <p>
                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
                the following applies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                  purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
                  allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                  such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent
                  or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does
                  not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject
                  to European data protection law;
                </li>
                <li>
                  provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                  agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                  obligations thereof;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                  to which the Owner is subject;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                  public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in the Owner;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                  interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
                legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
                into a contract.
              </p>
              <h3>Place</h3>
              <p>
                The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in
                any other places where the parties involved in the processing
                are located.<br /><br />
                Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
                transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.
                To find out more about the place of processing of such
                transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details
                about the processing of Personal Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
                transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
                international organization governed by public international law
                or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about
                the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their
                Data.<br /><br />
                If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
                checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
                the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
              </p>
              <h3>Retention time</h3>
              <p>
                Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
                required by the purpose they have been collected for.
              </p>
              <p>Therefore:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Personal Data collected for purposes related to the
                  performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall
                  be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s
                  legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
                  fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                  regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within
                  the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                  Owner.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
                period whenever the User has given consent to such processing,
                as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner
                may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period
                whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal
                obligation or upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
                Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be
                deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure,
                the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

                marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of
                this document.
